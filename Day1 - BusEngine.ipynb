    "- Let $U_1$ be the utility from purchasing the good which can be represented as: $$U_1(x,\\epsilon) = u_1(x) + \\epsilon_1 $$\n",
    "- Not buying the product has a deterministic component normalized to zero: $u_0 = 0$, $U_2(x,\\epsilon) = \\epsilon_2$.\n",
    "- The idiosyncratic utility draws are iid from a Type I Extreme Value, which in turn means that $\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_0$ follows a logistic distribution.\n",
    "- Hence $P(buy) = P(U_1(x,\\epsilon) > U_2(x,\\epsilon)) = P(\\epsilon_1 - \\epsilon_0 > u_1(x) - u_0(x)) = \\frac{exp(u_1(x) - u_0(x))}{1 + exp(u_1(x) - u_0(x))}$\n",
    "- Furthermore the deterministic component $u_1$ can be parametrizedL $u_1(x) = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 x$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we observe $N$ individuals decisions, then $\\mathbf{\\theta} = (\\theta_0,\\theta_1)$ can be estimated by maximum likelihood. Denoting $d_n$ as the decision of individual 1, which takes value 0 when she does not purchase the product and value 1 when she does gives the likelihood contribution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider the model of bus engine replacement, as studied by Rust (1987). Mr. Zurcher maintains a fleet of buses and is in charge of maintaining it and replacing the bus engines. As the mileage in the buses increases maintenance becomes more costly. Mr. Zurcher can replace the engine, which takes the mileage of the bus to zero, but replacing the engine is costly, more so than a one period maintenance. The problem that Mr. Zurcher faces is when to change the engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are $N$ buses that are observed in $T$ months.\n",
    "- In each period $t$ bus engine can be replaced $d_{1t} = 1$ or not replaced $d_{2t} = 1$. Both actions are mutually exclusive.\n",
    "- Each bus has a permanent state $s$ and has a mileage $x_t$ which increases overtime when the engine is not replaced and resets to 1 when the engine is replaced. Then the state transition when the engine is replaced is denoted as $f_{1}(1|x_t) = 1$.\n",
    "- The state transition when the engine is replaced follows a discretized exponential distribution, with a maximum mileage $\\bar{x}$, after which no further mileage is accumulated.\n",
